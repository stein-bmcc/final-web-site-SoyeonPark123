    <p>
        Soyeon was born on May 29, 1995, at 3:39 AM in a maternity clinic in Jongno-gu, Seoul, South Korea.
        Soyeon's mother had a dream while pregnant with Soyeon, where she was holding a handful of beautiful cherries.
        She is the youngest of three siblings, with an older sister and an older brother.When Soyeon was a newborn, she apparently slept on her 8-year-older sister's stomach and ended up wetting it.
    
Anyway, this cute baby grew up to become a 29-year-old adult woman. </p>
